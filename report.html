        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <!-- Website description !-->
        <p> My website is a fan magazine of Star Wars that aims to inform the fans about what new things happening in Star 
            Wars world through every medium whether it be films, series, and games. However the website is not only for 
            already existing Star Wars, we have pages like Movies and History that aims to help casual people who are interested.
        </p>
        <!-- Website structure !-->
        <p>
            To make it simple and intuitive for users I decided on this 5 page template with flat structure:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Home</b></li>
            <li><b>News</b></li>
            <li><b>Movies</b></li>
            <li><b>History</b></li>
            <li><b>Contact Us</b></li>   
        </ul>

    <!-- Inspiration section!-->
    <section>
        <h2>State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website.</h2>
        <ol>
            <!-- First inspiration!-->
            <li> Biggest inspiration while building my own website was official Star Wars website <b>starwars.com</b>.
                I wanted to emulate their simplistic yet stylish dark, white, and muted grey colors. Also one more thing
                that influenced my website is their star background image that engulfes everything on the website. While 
                not as good, I hope my rendition can touch people like the official website. 
            </li>
            <!-- Second inspiration !-->
            <li> While ago I came across a website made by a single developer that was made by pure CSS "http://www.species-in-pieces.com/#". While it did not
                 influence any part of my website directly, this inspiration wanted me to push and explore more into vanilla CSS.
            </li>
            <!-- Third inspiration!-->
            <li>
                I was inspirted by how minimalistic but still highly usable/functional Instagram and Facebook are. There is not
                a lot of highly technical animation in either of them but Meta finds that good meduim that makes it simple and effective 
            </li> 
        </ol>

    <!-- Accessiblity section !-->
    <section>
        <h2>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible.</h2>
        <p> Every page has been accessiblity checked through both WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool and Googles Lighthouse
            to make sure it is accessible for people with disabilities </p>
        <ol>
            <!-- First accessiblity!-->
            <li> First, every page has proper font size and color that contrast the background so people with visual impairment
                 can texts on the website 
            </li>
            <!-- Second accessiblity !-->
            <li> Also every picture has been tagged with proper and consice alt description so people who uses screen reader can navigate the website
                without problem.
            </li>
            <!-- Third accessiblity!-->
            <li>
                Lastly, I made so every actionable elements like buttons and links are accessible through TAB key so people 
                who only use keyboard to navigate can reach every part of the website.
            </li> 
        </ol>

    <!-- Usability section !-->
    <section>
        <h2>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site</h2>
        <ol>
            <!-- First usability!-->
            <li> While we live in a era where fast internet connection is common thing, there are still lot of people who has poor connection. 
                 By using Google Lighthouse audition report the website has been improved in performance and usability. Not only every picture has
                changed to smaller JPG format instead of PNG, pictures have been also sized properly to reduce to size and improve performance.
                On top of that embeded youtube video has loading attribute lazy so it does not affect the performance unless user wants to play
                the video
            </li>
            <!-- Second usability !-->
            <li> 
                More and more people are using mobile phones to navigate through the web. To accommodate that my website works on wide 
                range of variety of devices from wide screen to tablet to phone. Responsive design increase the usability through making 
                it easy to navigate while on phone whether it by changing the font size or morphing into entirely new layout.
            </li>
            <!-- Third usability!-->
            <li>
                Other small convenience goes long way to improve UX and usability. My website reacts to user interaction by 
                buttons and pictures gets bigger, links changes color to indicate that it's actionable element. There are also
                small convenient things like scroll to top button and logo directing to home page are implemented.
            </li> 
        </ol>

    <!-- New knowledge learned !-->
    <section>
        <h2>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe
            how you did that</h2>

            <ol>
                <!-- First new knowledge!-->
                <li> Before this course I was complete beginner in HTML, infact my first website was themepark website my team 
                    made during midterm. While learning both HTML and CSS as beginner was challenge, it was a fun ride so much 
                    so that I am thinking about changing my specialization to Web Dev. Best thing that helped me start was "HTML5 and CSS3 for Dummies"
                    by Andy Harris.  
                </li>
                <!-- Second knowledge !-->
                <li> I have been using websites since I was a child, but never knew how much developers put 
                    into their website to make it accessible for everyone. First time I ran Wave accessiblity check I had 14 errors
                    and 20 warnings. I read through every single one of them and got to know how helpful small accessiblity addition
                    to the code can be to other people.
                </li>
                <!-- Third knowledge!-->
                <li>
                    Most fun I thing learned was CSS grid and CSS flex. Playing around with both of them gave me good understanding
                    when to use either one of them. While flexbox is great for aligning things in one dimension through justify-content
                    and align-items, I found grid to be much more useful when designing content with lot of components like the History page. 
                    Use of two dimensions with row and columns was much more easier to style.
                </li>

    <section>
        <h2>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?</h2>

        <p> For a second ever website I made, I am proud that I was able to create simple yet effective and nice looking
            website. I think the best part of my website is Javascript. Pretty much every page uses Javascript DOM to manipulate 
            elements position, display, and color. While I learned it just few months ago, I am also proud of my HTML usage. 
            I believe I used wide variety of tags from unordered list, ordered list, section, footer, header, list and paragraph.
            For CSS part I was able to figure out and use some complex ideas like accordian dropdown for FAQ section and hamburger 
            navigation with just tinkering around.

    <section>
        <h2>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently
            another time?</h2>

        <p> While I made considerable effort in accessiblity part, I will try to improve it even more by adding features like
            Dyslexic font, text size slider, and white mode for people who have difficulties reading in dark mode. Also I would love
            to implement much more diverse medias such as a music when the page first load. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For things I would do differently: I would like to experiment and use much more CSS animation. When I first started 
            I wanted to implement introduction like Star Wars movies where text fly from bottom to top, but gave up after few tries
            after learning how difficult it would be to actually code. Next time I will have my "A long time ago in galaxy far, far away"
            For reference: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXDnFYu91vY&ab_channel=allluckyseven".
